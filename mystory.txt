I have opened this and am adding to it!

I swam in a waterfall in Portland this weekend.

I am now creating a new story.

(P1) Here are words. More new  words to see! GONNA MAKE THAT CHANGE

(P2) i was born inside of a taco bell steak quesarito

(P3) I was born from an egg, and found myself hatch into a moderately larger egg.

(P2) I went to a cider mill over the weekend and had delicious fresh cider and donuts.

(P2) This line should conflict with P3's new line

(P3) My favorite food is a hearty beef stroganoff.
